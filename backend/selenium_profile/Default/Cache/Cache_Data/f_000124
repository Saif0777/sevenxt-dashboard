This paper proposes a hybrid data-driven framework integrating Evidential Reasoning (ER) with a Random Forest (RF) classifier for enhanced automobile insurance fraud detec- tion. The ER mechanism transforms expert-defined indicators into belief distributions, providing interpretable reasoning for fraud likelihood, while the RF model learns complex patterns from historical claim records to improve predictive performance. A cost-sensitive learning strategy is incorporated to address class imbalance without altering the original dataset distribution. Ex- perimental evaluation on a benchmark dataset and a real-world automobile insurance dataset demonstrates that the proposed ER–RF hybrid model achieves higher accuracy, improved F1- score, and reduced false positives compared to traditional ER or standalone machine learning techniques. This integration enables a more reliable and intelligent fraud detection system suitable for modern insurance analytics.

INTRODUCTION Automobile insurance fraud continues to be a major concern for insurance organizations and policyholders worldwide. Re- ports indicate that billions are lost annually due to fraudulent claims, including those that remain undetected [1], [2], [3]. As fraud patterns have become more sophisticated, early and ac- curate fraud identification has become essential for minimizing unnecessary claim settlements and operational costs. Traditional fraud detection systems predominantly rely on expert-driven rule-based logic, where domain analysts de- fine fixed red-flag indicators. Although these approaches are interpretable, they frequently suffer from subjectivity, bias, limited generalization capability, and inconsistent decision- making across evaluators. Such limitations often result in higher false positive and false negative outcomes, impacting customer experience and loss control. Recent research directions emphasize leveraging machine learning techniques for modeling complex insurance claim behavior. Ensemble-based methods, particularly Random For- est (RF), have demonstrated strong performance in identifying nonlinear relationships and hidden interactions within claims data. However, despite promising results, these approaches typically function as black-box systems with restricted inter- pretability, which limits their acceptance in regulated financial environments [4], [6], [7], [8], [9]. In contrast, Evidential Reasoning (ER), which is rooted in Dempster–Shafer theory, supports reasoning under incomplete and uncertain information while offering transparent inter- pretable outcomes [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17],[18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Considering the comple- mentary properties of both approaches, this work proposes a hybrid ER–RF framework that integrates interpretable expert- based evidential belief scoring with data-driven ensemble learning. This integration","© November 2025 | IJIRT | Volume 12 Issue 6 | ISSN: 2349-6002 IJIRT 186816 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE RESEARCH IN TECHNOLOGY 4911 aims to enhance fraud detection accuracy while retaining interpretability required for trust and deployment in real operational insurance environments. II. RELATED WORK Research on insurance fraud detection spans expert- driven rea- soning models, traditional statistical approaches, and modern machine learning methods. Early work primarily utilized rule- based detection strategies, where domain specialists encoded suspicious claim indicators based on prior fraud knowledge. Although these methods were explainable, they lacked scal- ability and often struggled to adapt to new, evolving fraud patterns in real-world environments [4], [3]. Subsequent studies explored supervised learning approaches such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and ensemble-based classifiers. While these meth- ods improved predictive capability, their performance often degraded on imbalanced datasets where fraudulent cases con- stituted a minority portion of total claims [5], [26]. Moreover, ensemble models like Random Forest demonstrated competi- tive results in insurance domains, yet their inherent black-box nature limited interpretability and traceability—both of which are crucial in insurance auditing and regulatory contexts [6], [7], [8]. More recent literature examined hybrid frameworks that blend machine learning with evidential reasoning concepts to incor- porate uncertainty modeling into decision logic [20], [23], [24]. Evidential Reasoning, grounded in Dempster–Shafer theory, supports inference with incomplete, vague, and con- flicting information sources, and has been effective in multiple decision-support applications [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16],[17], [18], [19], [21], [22]. However, most prior ER-based fraud detection frameworks depend predominantly on human expertise and fixed rule structures, making them less suitable for large-scale insurance environments where historical data volume continues to grow. Research Gap and Motivation: Prior hybrid approaches either emphasized predictive performance without retaining interpretability, or focused mainly on evidential modeling without leveraging data-driven adaptability. The proposed ER– RF hybrid model addresses this gap by integrating ER- based interpretability with RF-based predictive strength and introducing cost sensitivity to better handle imbalance and reduce misclassification impact. This design ensures both transparency and improved fraud detection capacity in real insurance applications. III. INPUT AND OUTPUT FORMULATION A. Input Description This study utilizes a real automobile insurance claim dataset obtained from Kennedys Law LLP in collaboration with the University of Manchester. The dataset contains 718 claim samples and includes 49 domain-specific expert fraud indica- tors. These indicators evaluate multiple operational dimensions such as accident chronology, treatment and repair details, pol- icy duration, number of involved parties, and cost distribution. Each indicator is encoded in binary form (1/0) to reflect whether a specific fraud- related trigger condition is met. In addition to expert- driven binary indicators, several continuous and categorical claim-level attributes (e.g., claim amount, vehicle type, severity, claimant history) are incorporated as inputs to the Random Forest classifier. These features collectively form the integrated input space for the hybrid ER–RF model, where ER transforms rule-based expert indicators into belief distributions and RF contributes learning-based probabilistic inference from historical records.

Data Imbalance and Cost Sensitivity Handling The dataset exhibits noticeable class imbalance, where le- gitimate claims significantly outnumber fraudulent samples. Directly applying standard machine learning models under such imbalance can result in biased outcomes favoring the majority class, especially when the cost of misclassifying fraud cases (false negatives) is far greater than incorrectly flagging genuine claims (false positives). While common imbalance handling strategies such as un- dersampling, oversampling, and SMOTE can be","© November 2025 | IJIRT | Volume 12 Issue 6 | ISSN: 2349-6002 IJIRT 186816 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE RESEARCH IN TECHNOLOGY 4912 applied, they modify underlying data distributions and may degrade interpretability which is a critical aspect of Evidential Rea- soning. To retain original claim semantics, this work employs a cost-sensitive learning strategy within the Random Forest clas- sifier, assigning increased misclassification penalty to minority fraudulent class instances. This approach improves balanced detection performance without synthetic data modification [26], [27], [28], [29], [30].

Output Definition Most insurance companies traditionally rely on rule- based expert systems where red-flag indicators are encoded in IF– THEN logical structures. Although interpretable, these mech- anisms frequently lead to high false positive rates due to rigid conditional thresholds. To address this, the proposed hybrid model integrates evidential reasoning-based belief inference with Random Forest predictive learning to generate a more reliable probabilistic decision output. In the proposed ER–RF architecture, the ER module produces belief values representing the likelihood of a claim belonging to the High-Risk Fraud or Low Risk Legitimate category. These belief values are then fused with the probabilistic predictions generated by the Random Forest classifier. The final decision output for a claim is represented as a belief- weighted probabilistic pair such as: Decision = {(High Risk, 0.78), (Low Risk, 0.22)} This hybrid belief output reduces false accusations of le- gitimate claimants while improving fraud case identification efficiency.

OUTLINE OF THE HYBRID ER–RF MODEL The proposed hybrid ER–RF framework integrates in- terpretable evidential reasoning mechanisms with robust ensemble-based machine learning to improve the reliability of automobile insurance fraud detection. Evidential Reasoning (ER), derived from Dempster– Shafer theory, models uncertain domain knowledge and transforms expert-defined indicators into belief distributions defining the likelihood of fraud or non- fraud states [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. These belief scores retain interpretability while supporting reasoning under incomplete or partially conflicting indicator evidence. In parallel, the Random Forest (RF) classifier learns nonlinear structural interactions from historical automobile insurance claims. RF outputs posterior probabilities PRF(h) for each hypothesis (fraud / legitimate), estimated over multiple deci- sion trees to improve generalization stability [25]. The hybrid system jointly benefits from ER-based transparency and RF- based prediction strength. The belief distribution ph,i produced by the ER module for evidence ei is fused with RF prediction probability according to a reliability-weighted rule: mh,e(i) = wi ph,i + (1 − wi) PRF(hi), (1) where wi ∈ [0, 1] denotes the reliability of expert- driven evidence. Recursive evidence aggregation uses a normalization factor to ensure Σh mh,e(i) = 1 across the combined mass distribution.","© November 2025 | IJIRT | Volume 12 Issue 6 | ISSN: 2349-6002 IJIRT 186816 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE RESEARCH IN TECHNOLOGY 4913 Fig. 2.

Relationship between Bayes’ rule, Dempster’s rule and the Evidential Reasoning (ER) framework. ER generalizes and extends conventional proba- bilistic inference to support reasoning with uncertainty and evidence conflict. This hybrid fusion ensures that when historical data is rich and reliable, RF contributes more strongly; otherwise, ER dominates the inference process. V. DATA-DRIVEN HYBRID ER–RF METHODOLOGY This section describes the operational inference mechanism used by the proposed hybrid ER–RF model to compute fraud likelihood across automobile claim cases. A. RF-Based Probability Learning The Random Forest component learns complex nonlinear re- lationships present in historical insurance claim data. For each claim instance, the RF model produces a posterior probability score PRF(h) representing the likelihood of belonging to the fraud or legitimate class. Since the final outcome is derived by averaging predictions across multiple decision trees, the model provides stable inference while minimizing overfitting and variance issues commonly encountered in single-tree classifiers [4], [6], [7], [8], [9]. B. Expert-Based Evidential Likelihood Computation Expert-designed indicators are transformed into belief values reflecting subjective risk perceptions related to fraud. Eviden tial Reasoning converts these indicators into normalized belief scores PER(h), capturing different levels of uncertainty and enabling transparent interpretation of expert judgments based on Dempster–Shafer evidence aggregation theory [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22],[23], [24]. This step allows the system to preserve explainabil- ity and reason under incomplete or imprecise evidence. C. Hybrid Fusion Strategy Both likelihood values derived from RF and ER are combined to form a unified fraud probability using reliability-based weighted fusion: where w denotes the reliability weight assigned to expert belief knowledge, and (1 − w) reflects the influence of learning- based inference. The balance parameter w allows dynamic control: expert influence increases when historical data is weak or sparse, while RF influence increases when sufficient data supports empirical inference. D. Hybrid ER–RF Fusion Formula The final hybrid fraud likelihood is obtained by combining both evidential belief inference and Random Forest posterior probability using a reliability weighted fusion rule. Let PER(h) denote the belief score derived from Evidential Reasoning and PRF(h) denote the machine learning based prediction probability. The final hybrid estimation is defined as:","© November 2025 | IJIRT | Volume 12 Issue 6 | ISSN: 2349-6002 IJIRT 186816 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE RESEARCH IN TECHNOLOGY 4914 where λ ∈ [0, 1] is the reliability coefficient assigned to expert driven belief evidence. When expert confidence is high λ increases, while in data-rich scenarios RF contributes more strongly to the final inference. This formulation ensures bal- anced trust between interpretable knowledge driven evidence and data- driven statistical learning. E. ER–RF Hybrid Algorithm F. Workflow of the Proposed Hybrid Model The complete automated ER–RF inference workflow is shown in Fig. 2. The step-by-step processing sequence is summarized below: 1) Collect and preprocess raw automobile claim data. 2) Extract expert-defined indicators and generate structured historical data-based features. 3) Apply Evidential Reasoning (ER) to derive belief- oriented fraud likelihood scores. 4) Train the Random Forest model on historical labeled data to generate prediction probabilities. 5) Fuse ER belief outputs with RF posterior outputs to compute the final hybrid fraud likelihood score. 6) Perform cost-sensitive parameter optimization based on insurer feedback to reduce false negatives and improve real-world fraud screening reliability. G. Weight Optimization Mechanism Reliability weights are optimized using Sequential Quadratic Programming to minimize total misclassification loss. A cost- sensitive optimization formulation is employed, ensuring that false negatives (missed fraud cases) incur higher penalty values to improve minority class recall under skewed distributions [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. H. Deployment Interpretation The hybrid inference pipeline is designed to support practical enterprise-grade insurance operations. ER ensures transparent reasoning logic for auditing and compliance, while RF en- sures generalizable fraud detection performance in large-scale claim environments. The proposed integration supports both interpretability and predictive enhancement, which are key I. Local and Global Explainability using SHAP To improve model transparency and interpretability, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) based explainability analysis was incorporated into the hybrid ER–RF framework. SHAP computes contribution strength of each fraud indicator and claim feature by estimating their additive marginal effect on final prediction score. The global SHAP importance plot high lights the most influential attributes driving fraud decisions, while local SHAP instance-wise plots interpret individual case This allows insurance auditors and claim investigators to understand why a claim was classified as fraud or legitimate, improving trust, transparency, and regulatory compliance. By integrating ER explainability with SHAP model attribution the proposed hybrid system provides dual layer interpretability which is rarely present in existing machine learning fraud detection frameworks VI.

The objective is to assess the effec- tiveness of the proposed ER–RF hybrid approach in terms of prediction stability, imbalanced behavior handling, and improved fraud classification capability.","© November 2025 | IJIRT | Volume 12 Issue 6 | ISSN: 2349-6002 IJIRT 186816 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE RESEARCH IN TECHNOLOGY 4915 A. Benchmark Dataset Analysis The UCI credit card fraud dataset [31] is adopted for baseline comparison. The dataset is partitioned using a 70–30 training– testing split, and 10-fold cross validation is applied to ensure stable result estimation. Classical machine learning models including Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Trees (DT), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Random Forest (RF), as well as standalone ER, are compared against the proposed hybrid ER–RF model.

Automobile Insurance Fraud Detection Results To validate real-world applicability, the hybrid model is tested on the industrial automobile insurance dataset containing his- torical policy records, accident information, and expert-defined indicators. As fraudulent claims represent minority proportion, missing them results in higher economic impact.

VII. CONCLUSION This paper introduced a hybrid Evidential Reasoning– Random Forest (ER–RF) framework for transparent and accurate au- tomobile insurance fraud detection. The approach integrates belief-based inference derived from expert fraud indicators with data-driven probability estimation from ensemble learn- ing models. The ER mechanism provides traceable justification for decision outcomes, while the Random Forest component improves predictive power by learning nonlinear relationships within historical claim data. To further mitigate the effects of class imbalance, a cost- sensitive learning strategy was incorporated to penalize mis- classification of minority fraudulent cases more strongly. Ex- perimental evaluation using both a benchmark dataset and a real insurance claim dataset demonstrated that the hybrid ER– RF model delivers higher accuracy, improved F1 scores, and enhanced AUC performance compared to standalone ER or RF approaches. The outcome shows that combining interpretability with ro- bust data-driven learning provides a scalable and practically deployable fraud screening solution for insurance companies. Future enhancements may explore hierarchical belief rule modeling and maximum-likelihood ER integration to support even more complex multi-level fraud dependency structures across large-scale commercial environments.
